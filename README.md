# Rule_Breakers

The markdown file `Figures for Biology Letters manuscript.Rmd` contains the code to reproduce figure 1 and 2, using compiled data extracted from the control model set and feeding + growth model sets.

The empirical data from Murphy et al. 2020 is also included.

The size structured model code is in `PZCeF Model.R` and the script to run the model is `Run Model.Rmd`. 

Functions to extract diet, abundance, biomass etc data from the mmodels are in `Functions BioLett.R`

It is inevitable I have missed a file or two, so please get in touch if you need any additional information or assistance.
